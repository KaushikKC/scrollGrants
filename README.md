# Resolve: A Community-Driven Funding Platform

## Overview

Resolve is a public good platform designed to empower communities in collaboratively funding and supporting initiatives that address pressing public challenges. By leveraging innovative funding mechanisms and advanced AI technologies, Resolve aims to create a more equitable funding landscape that benefits both popular and lesser-known projects.

## Problem

In traditional funding systems, popular projects tend to receive more attention and resources, overshadowing smaller but crucial initiatives that need support.

## Solution

Resolve addresses this issue through the following mechanisms:

- *Quadratic Funding*:  
  Resolve ensures fair distribution of funds, where smaller contributions are amplified, allowing vital projects to compete on equal footing.

- *ORA AI*:  
  By analyzing user goals, ORA AI combats bias and recommends projects that truly align with individual values, ensuring lesser-known but impactful projects get noticed.

- *Security Measures*:  
  Resolve implements strict security measures to prevent bots from manipulating the voting process, safeguarding the integrity of contributions and ensuring a truly community-driven outcome.
